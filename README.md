##  Photomosaic Portrait Using Python
A photomosaic iss a picture that has been divided into equal sized tiled sections, each of which is replaced with another photograph that matches the target photo. When viewed at low magnifications, the individual pixels appear as the primary image, while close examination reveals that the image is in fact made up of many hundreds or thousands of smaller images. Most of the time they are a computer-created type of montage.
In this repository, I implement an algorithm to generate a photomosaic portraits using Python.
##### Here is an example of a photmosaic portrait generated using random pictures of Kanye West and his album covers:

<img style="float: right;" src="/example/kanye.jpg" width="200" height="200" >
<img style="float: left;" src="/example/kanye_try2.jpeg" width="200" height="200" float="left" />
